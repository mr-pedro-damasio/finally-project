# FinAlly — AI Trading Workstation

## Project Specification

## 1. Vision

FinAlly (Finance Ally) is a visually stunning AI-powered trading workstation that streams live market data, lets users trade a simulated portfolio, and integrates an LLM chat assistant that can analyze positions and execute trades on the user's behalf. It looks and feels like a modern Bloomberg terminal with an AI copilot.

This is the capstone project for an agentic AI coding course. It is built entirely by Coding Agents demonstrating how orchestrated AI agents can produce a production-quality full-stack application. Agents interact through files in `planning/`.

## 2. User Experience

### First Launch

The user runs a single Docker command (or a provided start script). A browser opens to `http://localhost:8000`. No login, no signup. They immediately see:

- A watchlist of 10 default tickers with live-updating prices in a grid
- $10,000 in virtual cash
- A dark, data-rich trading terminal aesthetic
- An AI chat panel ready to assist

### What the User Can Do

- **Watch prices stream** — prices flash green (uptick) or red (downtick) with subtle CSS animations that fade
- **View sparkline mini-charts** — price action beside each ticker in the watchlist, accumulated on the frontend from the SSE stream since page load (sparklines fill in progressively)
- **Click a ticker** to see a larger detailed chart in the main chart area
- **Buy and sell shares** — market orders only, instant fill at current price, no fees, no confirmation dialog
- **Monitor their portfolio** — a heatmap (treemap) showing positions sized by weight and colored by P&L, plus a P&L chart tracking total portfolio value over time
- **View a positions table** — ticker, quantity, average cost, current price, unrealized P&L, % change
- **Chat with the AI assistant** — ask about their portfolio, get analysis, and have the AI execute trades and manage the watchlist through natural language
- **Manage the watchlist** — add/remove tickers manually or via the AI chat

### Visual Design

- **Dark theme**: backgrounds around `#0d1117` or `#1a1a2e`, muted gray borders, no pure black
- **Price flash animations**: brief green/red background highlight on price change, fading over ~500ms via CSS transitions
- **Connection status indicator**: a small colored dot (green = connected, yellow = reconnecting, red = disconnected) visible in the header
- **Professional, data-dense layout**: inspired by Bloomberg/trading terminals — every pixel earns its place
- **Responsive but desktop-first**: optimized for wide screens, functional on tablet

### Color Scheme
- Accent Yellow: `#ecad0a`
- Blue Primary: `#209dd7`
- Purple Secondary: `#753991` (submit buttons)

## 3. Architecture Overview

### Single Container, Single Port

```

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript, built as a static export (`output: 'export'`), served by FastAPI as static files
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), managed as a `uv` project
- **Database**: SQLite, single file at `db/finally.db`, volume-mounted for persistence
- **Real-time data**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) — simpler than WebSockets, one-way server→client push, works everywhere
- **AI integration**: LiteLLM → OpenRouter (Cerebras for fast inference), with structured outputs for trade execution
- **Market data**: Environment-variable driven — simulator by default, real data via Massive API if key provided

### Why These Choices

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| SSE over WebSockets | One-way push is all we need; simpler, no bidirectional complexity, universal browser support |
| Static Next.js export | Single origin, no CORS issues, one port, one container, simple deployment |
| SQLite over Postgres | No auth = no multi-user = no need for a database server; self-contained, zero config |
| Single Docker container | Students run one command; no docker-compose for production, no service orchestration |
| uv for Python | Fast, modern Python project management; reproducible lockfile; what students should learn |
| Market orders only | Eliminates order book, limit order logic, partial fills — dramatically simpler portfolio math |

### Key Boundaries

- **`frontend/`** is a self-contained Next.js project. It knows nothing about Python. It talks to the backend via `/api/*` endpoints and `/api/stream/*` SSE endpoints. Internal structure is up to the Frontend Engineer agent.
- **`backend/`** is a self-contained uv project with its own `pyproject.toml`. It owns all server logic including database initialization, schema, seed data, API routes, SSE streaming, market data, and LLM integration. Internal structure is up to the Backend/Market Data agents.
- **`backend/schema/`** contains schema SQL definitions and seed logic. The backend lazily initializes the database on first request — creating tables and seeding default data if the SQLite file doesn't exist or is empty.
- **`db/`** at the top level is the runtime volume mount point. The SQLite file (`db/finally.db`) is created here by the backend and persists across container restarts via Docker volume.
- **`planning/`** contains project-wide documentation, including this plan. All agents reference files here as the shared contract.
- **`test/`** contains Playwright E2E tests and supporting infrastructure (e.g., `docker-compose.test.yml`). Unit tests live within `frontend/` and `backend/` respectively, following each framework's conventions.
- **`scripts/`** contains start/stop scripts that wrap Docker commands.

## 5. Environment Variables

```bash
# Required: OpenRouter API key for LLM chat functionality
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key-here

# Optional: Massive (Polygon.io) API key for real market data
# If not set, the built-in market simulator is used (recommended for most users)
MASSIVE_API_KEY=

# Optional: Set to "true" for deterministic mock LLM responses (testing)
LLM_MOCK=false
```

### Behavior

- If `MASSIVE_API_KEY` is set and non-empty → backend uses Massive REST API for market data
- If `MASSIVE_API_KEY` is absent or empty → backend uses the built-in market simulator
- If `LLM_MOCK=true` → backend returns deterministic mock LLM responses (for E2E tests)
- The backend reads `.env` from the project root (mounted into the container or read via docker `--env-file`)

---

## 6. Market Data

### Two Implementations, One Interface

Both the simulator and the Massive client implement the same abstract interface. The backend selects which to use based on the environment variable. All downstream code (SSE streaming, price cache, frontend) is agnostic to the source.

### Simulator (Default)

- Generates prices using geometric Brownian motion (GBM) with configurable drift and volatility per ticker
- Updates at ~500ms intervals
- Correlated moves across tickers (e.g., tech stocks move together)
- Occasional random "events" — sudden 2-5% moves on a ticker for drama
- Starts from realistic seed prices (e.g., AAPL ~$190, GOOGL ~$175, etc.)
- Runs as an in-process background task — no external dependencies

### Massive API (Optional)

- REST API polling (not WebSocket) — simpler, works on all tiers
- Polls for the union of all watched tickers on a configurable interval
- Free tier (5 calls/min): poll every 15 seconds
- Paid tiers: poll every 2-15 seconds depending on tier
- Parses REST response into the same format as the simulator
- When `add_ticker` is called, the Massive client must immediately issue a one-shot poll for that single ticker to seed the cache before the next regular poll interval — this prevents a blank price row in the UI for up to 15 seconds

### Shared Price Cache

- A single background task (simulator or Massive poller) writes to an in-memory price cache
- The cache holds the latest price, previous tick price, session-open price, and timestamp for each ticker
- SSE streams read from this cache and push updates to connected clients
- This architecture supports future multi-user scenarios without changes to the data layer
- The cache exposes a `get_all_with_version()` method that atomically snapshots both the version counter and all price data under the cache lock — SSE generators must use this method to avoid a read-split race between the version check and data fetch
- Ticker normalization (uppercase + strip whitespace) is applied at the `PriceCache` boundary — all callers receive canonicalized ticker symbols regardless of data source
- `PriceCache` uses `threading.Lock` (not `asyncio.Lock`) because the Massive polling path writes from worker threads via `asyncio.to_thread` — do not change this to an async lock

### SSE Streaming

- Endpoint: `GET /api/stream/prices`
- Long-lived SSE connection; client uses native `EventSource` API
- Server pushes price updates for all tickers known to the system at a regular cadence (~500ms) — in the single-user model this is equivalent to the user's watchlist
- **The stream is dynamic**: when a ticker is added to or removed from the watchlist, the background price task automatically includes or excludes it in subsequent pushes — no client reconnect is required
- Each SSE event contains: `ticker`, `price`, `prev_tick_price` (last tick's price), `session_open_price` (first price seen for this ticker in the current server session — set once, never updated), `timestamp`, and `direction`
- Client handles reconnection automatically (EventSource has built-in retry)
- The SSE generator emits a keepalive comment frame (`: ping`) every 15 seconds when no price updates have occurred, to prevent idle-timeout disconnections from intermediate proxies
- `create_stream_router()` must create a fresh `APIRouter` instance on each call — never reuse a module-level router instance — to prevent duplicate route registration on hot-reload or in tests

---

## 7. Database

### SQLite with Lazy Initialization

The backend checks for the SQLite database on startup (or first request). If the file doesn't exist or tables are missing, it creates the schema and seeds default data. This means:

- No separate migration step
- No manual database setup
- Fresh Docker volumes start with a clean, seeded database automatically

### Schema

All tables include a `user_id` column defaulting to `"default"`. This is hardcoded for now (single-user) but enables future multi-user support without schema migration.

**users_profile** — User state (cash balance)
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (default: `"default"`)
- `cash_balance` REAL (default: `10000.0`)
- `created_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

**watchlist** — Tickers the user is watching
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `ticker` TEXT
- `added_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)
- UNIQUE constraint on `(user_id, ticker)`

**positions** — Current holdings (one row per ticker per user)
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `ticker` TEXT
- `quantity` REAL (fractional shares supported)
- `avg_cost` REAL
- `updated_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)
- UNIQUE constraint on `(user_id, ticker)`

**trades** — Trade history (append-only log)
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `ticker` TEXT
- `side` TEXT (`"buy"` or `"sell"`)
- `quantity` REAL (fractional shares supported)
- `price` REAL
- `executed_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

**portfolio_snapshots** — Portfolio value over time (for P&L chart). Recorded every 30 seconds by a background task, and immediately after each trade execution.
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `total_value` REAL
- `recorded_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

Retention policy (applied by a background pruning task):
- Under 1 hour old: keep all snapshots (every ~30 seconds)
- 1–2 hours old: downsample to one snapshot per minute
- 2–4 hours old: downsample to one snapshot per 5 minutes
- Older than 4 hours: downsample to one snapshot per hour

**chat_messages** — Conversation history with LLM
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `role` TEXT (`"user"` or `"assistant"`)
- `content` TEXT
- `created_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

**chat_actions** — Actions executed by the AI in response to a chat message (normalized for queryability)
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `message_id` TEXT (foreign key → `chat_messages.id`)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `action_type` TEXT (`"trade"` or `"watchlist_change"`)
- `ticker` TEXT
- `side` TEXT (trades: `"buy"`/`"sell"`; watchlist changes: `"add"`/`"remove"`)
- `quantity` REAL (trades only; null for watchlist changes)
- `price` REAL (trades only; null for watchlist changes)
- `status` TEXT (`"executed"` or `"failed"`)
- `error` TEXT (null if successful)
- `created_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

### Default Seed Data

- One user profile: `id="default"`, `cash_balance=10000.0`
- Ten watchlist entries: AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, META, JPM, V, NFLX

## 8. API Endpoints

### Market Data
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/stream/prices` | SSE stream of live price updates |

### Portfolio
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/portfolio` | Current positions, cash balance, total value, unrealized P&L |
| POST | `/api/portfolio/trade` | Execute a trade: `{ticker, quantity, side}` |
| GET | `/api/portfolio/history` | Portfolio value snapshots over time (for P&L chart) |

### Watchlist
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/watchlist` | Current watchlist tickers with latest prices |
| POST | `/api/watchlist` | Add a ticker: `{ticker}` |
| DELETE | `/api/watchlist/{ticker}` | Remove a ticker |

**Ticker validation**: All endpoints that accept a ticker (watchlist POST, trade POST) must validate the ticker against the regex `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9.\-]{0,9}$` before processing. Return HTTP 422 with a descriptive error for invalid tickers. This boundary check prevents malformed or malicious strings from reaching the database or market data layer and mitigates prompt-injection risk from the LLM chat path.

### Chat
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/chat` | Send a message, receive complete JSON response (message + executed actions) |

### System
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/health` | Health check (for Docker/deployment) |

## 9. LLM Integration

When writing code to make calls to LLMs, use cerebras-inference skill to use LiteLLM via OpenRouter to the `openrouter/openai/gpt-oss-120b` model with Cerebras as the inference provider. Structured Outputs should be used to interpret the results.

There is an OPENROUTER_API_KEY in the .env file in the project root.

### How It Works

When the user sends a chat message, the backend:

1. Loads the user's current portfolio context (cash, positions with P&L, watchlist with live prices, total portfolio value)
2. Constructs a prompt with a system message, portfolio context, and the user's new message — **no conversation history is included; each session starts fresh**. Persistent session history is deferred to a future iteration.
3. Calls the LLM via LiteLLM → OpenRouter, requesting structured output, using the cerebras-inference skill
4. Parses the complete structured JSON response
5. Auto-executes any trades or watchlist changes specified in the response
6. Stores the user message and assistant message in `chat_messages`; stores each executed action as a row in `chat_actions`
7. Returns the complete JSON response to the frontend (no token-by-token streaming — Cerebras inference is fast enough that a loading indicator is sufficient)

### Structured Output Schema

The LLM is instructed to respond with JSON matching this schema:

```json
{
  "message": "Your conversational response to the user",
  "trades": [
    {"ticker": "AAPL", "side": "buy", "quantity": 10}
  ],
  "watchlist_changes": [
    {"ticker": "PYPL", "action": "add"},
    {"ticker": "NFLX", "action": "remove"}
  ]
}
```

- `message` (required): The conversational text shown to the user
- `trades` (optional): Array of trades to auto-execute. Each trade goes through the same validation as manual trades (sufficient cash for buys, sufficient shares for sells)
- `watchlist_changes` (optional): Array of watchlist modifications. Valid `action` values: `"add"` or `"remove"`

### Auto-Execution

Trades specified by the LLM execute automatically — no confirmation dialog. This is a deliberate design choice:
- It's a simulated environment with fake money, so the stakes are zero
- It creates an impressive, fluid demo experience
- It demonstrates agentic AI capabilities — the core theme of the course

If a trade fails validation (e.g., insufficient cash), the error is included in the chat response so the LLM can inform the user.

### System Prompt Guidance

The LLM should be prompted as "FinAlly, an AI trading assistant" with instructions to:
- Analyze portfolio composition, risk concentration, and P&L
- Suggest trades with reasoning
- Execute trades when the user asks or agrees
- Manage the watchlist proactively
- Be concise and data-driven in responses
- Always respond with valid structured JSON

### LLM Mock Mode

When `LLM_MOCK=true`, the backend returns deterministic mock responses instead of calling OpenRouter. This enables:
- Fast, free, reproducible E2E tests
- Development without an API key
- CI/CD pipelines

The mock response is fixed and must match exactly so E2E tests can make deterministic assertions:

```json
{
  "message": "I've analyzed your portfolio. I'll buy 5 shares of AAPL for you and add MSFT to your watchlist.",
  "trades": [{"ticker": "AAPL", "side": "buy", "quantity": 5}],
  "watchlist_changes": [{"ticker": "MSFT", "action": "add"}]
}
```

E2E tests should assert: the response message contains "AAPL", a buy trade for 5 AAPL executes (cash decreases, position appears), and MSFT appears in the watchlist.

---

## 10. Frontend Design

### Layout

The frontend is a single-page application with a dense, terminal-inspired layout. The specific component architecture and layout system is up to the Frontend Engineer, but the UI should include these elements:

- **Watchlist panel** — grid/table of watched tickers with: ticker symbol, current price (flashing green/red on change), session change % (computed as `(current_price − session_open_price) / session_open_price × 100`, displayed as "—" until the first SSE price arrives for that ticker), and a sparkline mini-chart (accumulated from SSE since page load)
- **Main chart area** — larger chart for the currently selected ticker, accumulating price-over-time data from the SSE stream since page load (same approach as sparklines). Shows "Waiting for price data…" until at least one data point is received. Clicking a ticker in the watchlist selects it here.
- **Portfolio heatmap** — treemap visualization where each rectangle is a position, sized by portfolio weight, colored by P&L (green = profit, red = loss)
- **P&L chart** — line chart showing total portfolio value over time, using data from `portfolio_snapshots`. While no snapshots exist yet (first 30 seconds of a session), the chart area displays an informational message: "Waiting for first data point…"
- **Positions table** — tabular view of all positions: ticker, quantity, avg cost, current price, unrealized P&L, % change
- **Trade bar** — simple input area: ticker field, quantity field, buy button, sell button. Market orders, instant fill.
- **AI chat panel** — docked/collapsible sidebar. Message input, scrolling conversation history, loading indicator while waiting for LLM response. Trade executions and watchlist changes shown inline as confirmations.
- **Header** — portfolio total value (updating live), connection status indicator, cash balance

### Technical Notes

- Use `EventSource` for SSE connection to `/api/stream/prices`
- Canvas-based charting library preferred (Lightweight Charts or Recharts) for performance
- Price flash effect: on receiving a new price, briefly apply a CSS class with background color transition, then remove it
- All API calls go to the same origin (`/api/*`) — no CORS configuration needed
- Tailwind CSS for styling with a custom dark theme

---

## 11. Docker & Deployment

### Multi-Stage Dockerfile

```
Stage 1: node:20-slim
  - Copy frontend/
  - npm install && npm run build (produces static export)

Stage 2: python:3.12-slim-bookworm
  - Install uv
  - Copy backend/
  - uv sync (install Python dependencies from lockfile)
  - Copy frontend build output into a static/ directory
  - Set PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 and PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
  - Create and switch to a non-root user (e.g. appuser)
  - Expose port 8000
  - HEALTHCHECK: GET /api/health every 30s, timeout 5s
  - CMD: uvicorn serving FastAPI app
```

FastAPI serves the static frontend files and all API routes on port 8000. Pin base image versions explicitly (`node:20-slim`, `python:3.12-slim-bookworm`) — avoid `latest` tags.

### Docker Volume

The SQLite database persists via a bind mount to the `db/` directory in the project root:

```bash
docker run -v "$(pwd)/db":/app/db -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env finally
```

Using a bind mount (not a named Docker volume) allows developers to inspect and backup the SQLite file directly from the host filesystem. The `db/.gitkeep` file ensures the directory exists in the repo; `db/finally.db` is gitignored. The backend writes `finally.db` to `/app/db/finally.db` inside the container.

### Start/Stop Scripts

**`scripts/start_mac.sh`** (macOS/Linux):
- Builds the Docker image if not already built (or if `--build` flag passed)
- Runs the container with the volume mount, port mapping, and `.env` file
- Prints the URL to access the app
- Optionally opens the browser

**`scripts/stop_mac.sh`** (macOS/Linux):
- Stops and removes the running container
- Does NOT remove the volume (data persists)

**`scripts/start_windows.ps1`** / **`scripts/stop_windows.ps1`**: PowerShell equivalents for Windows.

All scripts should be idempotent — safe to run multiple times.

### Optional Cloud Deployment

The container is designed to deploy to AWS App Runner, Render, or any container platform. A Terraform configuration for App Runner may be provided in a `deploy/` directory as a stretch goal, but is not part of the core build.

---

## 12. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (within `frontend/` and `backend/`)

**Backend (pytest)**:
- Market data: simulator generates valid prices, GBM math is correct, Massive API response parsing works, both implementations conform to the abstract interface
- Portfolio: trade execution logic, P&L calculations, edge cases (selling more than owned, buying with insufficient cash, selling at a loss)
- LLM: structured output parsing handles all valid schemas, graceful handling of malformed responses, trade validation within chat flow
- API routes: correct status codes, response shapes, error handling
- **SSE integration tests (required)**: using `httpx.AsyncClient` against the FastAPI `TestClient`, assert: (a) response `Content-Type` is `text/event-stream`, (b) the bootstrap `retry: 1000` frame is present, (c) at least one `data:` frame is emitted within the test timeout, and (d) the generator cleans up on client disconnect. These tests must exist before the SSE endpoint is considered complete.

**Frontend (React Testing Library or similar)**:
- Component rendering with mock data
- Price flash animation triggers correctly on price changes
- Watchlist CRUD operations
- Portfolio display calculations
- Chat message rendering and loading state

### CI Requirement

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) running `uv run --extra dev pytest` and `uv run --extra dev ruff check app/ tests/` must be added before any PR after the market data phase. This is the automated safety net for an agent-driven codebase.

### E2E Tests (in `test/`)

**Infrastructure**: A separate `docker-compose.test.yml` in `test/` that spins up the app container plus a Playwright container. This keeps browser dependencies out of the production image.

**Environment**: Tests run with `LLM_MOCK=true` by default for speed and determinism.

**Key Scenarios**:
- Fresh start: default watchlist appears, $10k balance shown, prices are streaming
- Add and remove a ticker from the watchlist
- Buy shares: cash decreases, position appears, portfolio updates
- Sell shares: cash increases, position updates or disappears
- Portfolio visualization: heatmap renders with correct colors, P&L chart has data points
- AI chat (mocked): send a message, receive a response, trade execution appears inline
- SSE resilience: disconnect and verify reconnection

---

## 13. Resolved Decisions

The following items were previously open questions. All have been resolved; the frontend and chat agents should use these decisions directly.

**Section 10 — Main chart area: data source** ✅ Resolved
The main chart accumulates price data from the SSE stream since page load (same approach as sparklines). No additional backend endpoint is needed. The chart displays "Waiting for price data…" until at least one data point is received for the selected ticker.

**Section 10 — Watchlist: change % definition** ✅ Resolved
The `PriceUpdate` SSE event includes a `session_open_price` field: the first price received for that ticker in the current server session (set once on first cache write, never changed). The watchlist "session change %" column is computed as `(current_price − session_open_price) / session_open_price × 100`. Displayed as "—" until the first SSE price arrives. The field formerly called `previous_price` is renamed `prev_tick_price` throughout the cache and SSE payload to make its tick-to-tick semantics explicit and prevent frontend agents from misusing it as a session-open reference.

**Section 9 — LLM mock: mock response content** ✅ Resolved
See §9 LLM Mock Mode for the fixed mock response and E2E assertion guidance.

---

## 14. Backend Entrypoint Requirements

`backend/app/main.py` is the FastAPI entrypoint and the integration point for all backend components. It must exist before any other agent builds on top of the backend. Required behavior:

- Create a `PriceCache` instance
- Use the factory (`backend/app/market/factory.py`) to create a `MarketDataSource` based on the `MASSIVE_API_KEY` environment variable
- Start the data source in a FastAPI `lifespan` async context manager (start on startup, stop on shutdown — no background tasks started outside lifespan)
- Mount the SSE router via `create_stream_router(price_cache)` using the `APIRouter` prefix `/api/stream`
- Expose `GET /api/health` returning `{"status": "ok"}`
- Do **not** add `CORSMiddleware` — the static export is served from the same origin, so CORS is not needed; adding `allow_origins=["*"]` would be a security regression
- Do not log `MASSIVE_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, or any secret value — and do not include them in error responses
